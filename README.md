# Student Event Feedback Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes student event feedback using data analysis and basic Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.  
The goal is to understand student sentiment, visualize feedback patterns, and derive actionable insights to improve future events.

The project demonstrates:
- Data cleaning and preparation using pandas
- Sentiment analysis using TextBlob
- Data visualization with matplotlib and seaborn
- Interpretation of feedback for decision-making

## Dataset Description
- **Source:** Synthetically generated dataset
- **Rows:** 100 student feedback entries
- **Columns:**
  - `Student_ID`: Unique identifier for each student
  - `Rating`: Event rating on a scale of 1–5
  - `Feedback`: Textual feedback provided by students

> **Note:**  
> The dataset was synthetically generated for educational purposes to demonstrate NLP and data analysis techniques.
